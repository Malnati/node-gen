# TypeScript Development

> These instructions assume projects are built with TypeScript 5.x (or newer) compiling to an ES2022 JavaScript baseline. Adjust guidance if your runtime requires older language targets or down-level transpilation.

## Core Intent

- Respect the existing architecture and coding standards.
- Prefer readable, explicit solutions over clever shortcuts.
- Extend current abstractions before inventing new ones.
- Prioritize maintainability and clarity, short methods and classes, clean code.

## General Guardrails

- Target TypeScript 5.x / ES2022 and prefer native features over polyfills.
- Use pure ES modules; never emit `require`, `module.exports`, or CommonJS helpers.
- Rely on the project's build, lint, and test scripts unless asked otherwise.
- Note design trade-offs when intent is not obvious.

## Project Organization

- Follow the repository's folder and responsibility layout for new code.
- Use kebab-case filenames (e.g., `user-session.ts`, `data-service.ts`) unless told otherwise.
- Keep tests, types, and helpers near their implementation when it aids discovery.
- Reuse or extend shared utilities before adding new ones.

## Naming & Style

- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, enums, and type aliases; camelCase for everything else.
- Skip interface prefixes like `I`; rely on descriptive names.
- Name things for their behavior or domain meaning, not implementation.

## Formatting & Style

- Run the repository's lint/format scripts (e.g., `npm run lint`) before submitting.
- Match the project's indentation, quote style, and trailing comma rules.
- Keep functions focused; extract helpers when logic branches grow.
- Favor immutable data and pure functions when practical.

## Type System Expectations

- Avoid `any` (implicit or explicit); prefer `unknown` plus narrowing.
- Use discriminated unions for realtime events and state machines.
- Centralize shared contracts instead of duplicating shapes.
- Express intent with TypeScript utility types (e.g., `Readonly`, `Partial`, `Record`).

## Async, Events & Error Handling

- Use `async/await`; wrap awaits in try/catch with structured errors.
- Guard edge cases early to avoid deep nesting.
- Send errors through the project's logging/telemetry utilities.
- Surface user-facing errors via the repository's notification pattern.
- Debounce configuration-driven updates and dispose resources deterministically.

## Architecture & Patterns

- Follow the repository's dependency injection or composition pattern; keep modules single-purpose.
- Observe existing initialization and disposal sequences when wiring into lifecycles.
- Keep transport, domain, and presentation layers decoupled with clear interfaces.
- Supply lifecycle hooks (e.g., `initialize`, `dispose`) and targeted tests when adding services.

## External Integrations

- Instantiate clients outside hot paths and inject them for testability.
- Never hardcode secrets; load them from secure sources.
- Apply retries, backoff, and cancellation to network or IO calls.
- Normalize external responses and map errors to domain shapes.

## Security Practices

- Validate and sanitize external input with schema validators or type guards.
- Avoid dynamic code execution and untrusted template rendering.
- Encode untrusted content before rendering HTML; use framework escaping or trusted types.
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to block injection.
- Keep secrets in secure storage, rotate them regularly, and request least-privilege scopes.
- Favor immutable flows and defensive copies for sensitive data.
- Use vetted crypto libraries only.
- Patch dependencies promptly and monitor advisories.

## Configuration & Secrets

- Reach configuration through shared helpers and validate with schemas or dedicated validators.
- Handle secrets via the project's secure storage; guard `undefined` and error states.
- Document new configuration keys and update related tests.

## UI & UX Components

- Sanitize user or external content before rendering.
- Keep UI layers thin; push heavy logic to services or state managers.
- Use messaging or events to decouple UI from business logic.

## Testing Expectations

- Add or update unit tests with the project's framework and naming style.
- Expand integration or end-to-end suites when behavior crosses modules or platform APIs.
- Run targeted test scripts for quick feedback before submitting.
- Avoid brittle timing assertions; prefer fake timers or injected clocks.

## Performance & Reliability

- Lazy-load heavy dependencies and dispose them when done.
- Defer expensive work until users need it.
- Batch or debounce high-frequency events to reduce thrash.
- Track resource lifetimes to prevent leaks.

## Documentation & Comments

- Add JSDoc to public APIs; include `@remarks` or `@example` when helpful.
- Write comments that capture intent, and remove stale notes during refactors.
- Update architecture or design docs when introducing significant patterns.

# Next.js Best Practices for LLMs (2026)

_Last updated: January 2026 (aligned to Next.js 16.1.1)_

This document summarizes the latest, authoritative best practices for building, structuring, and maintaining Next.js applications. It is intended for use by LLMs and developers to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

- **Use the `app/` directory** (App Router) for all new projects. Prefer it over the legacy `pages/` directory.
- **Top-level folders:**
  - `app/` — Routing, layouts, pages, and route handlers
  - `public/` — Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
  - `lib/` — Shared utilities, API clients, and logic
  - `components/` — Reusable UI components
  - `contexts/` — React context providers
  - `styles/` — Global and modular stylesheets
  - `hooks/` — Custom React hooks
  - `types/` — TypeScript type definitions
- **Colocation:** Place files (components, styles, tests) near where they are used, but avoid deeply nested structures.
- **Route Groups:** Use parentheses (e.g., `(admin)`) to group routes without affecting the URL path.
- **Private Folders:** Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_internal`) to opt out of routing and signal implementation details.

- **Feature Folders:** For large apps, group by feature (e.g., `app/dashboard/`, `app/auth/`).
- **Use `src/`** (optional): Place all source code in `src/` to separate from config files.

## 2.1. Server and Client Component Integration (App Router)

**Never use `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` inside a Server Component.** This is not supported and will cause a build/runtime error.

**Correct Approach:**

- If you need to use a Client Component (e.g., a component that uses hooks, browser APIs, or client-only libraries) inside a Server Component, you must:
  1. Move all client-only logic/UI into a dedicated Client Component (with `'use client'` at the top).
  2. Import and use that Client Component directly in the Server Component (no need for `next/dynamic`).
  3. If you need to compose multiple client-only elements (e.g., a navbar with a profile dropdown), create a single Client Component that contains all of them.

**Example:**

```tsx
// Server Component
import DashboardNavbar from "@/components/DashboardNavbar";

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  // ...server logic...
  return (
    <>
      <DashboardNavbar /> {/* This is a Client Component */}
      {/* ...rest of server-rendered page... */}
    </>
  );
}
```

**Why:**

- Server Components cannot use client-only features or dynamic imports with SSR disabled.
- Client Components can be rendered inside Server Components, but not the other way around.

**Summary:**
Always move client-only UI into a Client Component and import it directly in your Server Component. Never use `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` in a Server Component.

## 2.2. Next.js 16+ async request APIs (App Router)

- **Assume request-bound data is async in Server Components and Route Handlers.** In Next.js 16, APIs like `cookies()`, `headers()`, and `draftMode()` are async in the App Router.
- **Be careful with route props:** `params` / `searchParams` may be Promises in Server Components. Prefer `await`ing them instead of treating them as plain objects.
- **Avoid dynamic rendering by accident:** Accessing request data (cookies/headers/searchParams) opts the route into dynamic behavior. Read them intentionally and isolate dynamic parts behind `Suspense` boundaries when appropriate.

---

## 2. Component Best Practices

- **Component Types:**
  - **Server Components** (default): For data fetching, heavy logic, and non-interactive UI.
  - **Client Components:** Add `'use client'` at the top. Use for interactivity, state, or browser APIs.
- **When to Create a Component:**
  - If a UI pattern is reused more than once.
  - If a section of a page is complex or self-contained.
  - If it improves readability or testability.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Use `PascalCase` for component files and exports (e.g., `UserCard.tsx`).
  - Use `camelCase` for hooks (e.g., `useUser.ts`).
  - Use `snake_case` or `kebab-case` for static assets (e.g., `logo_dark.svg`).
  - Name context providers as `XyzProvider` (e.g., `ThemeProvider`).
- **File Naming:**
  - Match the component name to the file name.
  - For single-export files, default export the component.
  - For multiple related components, use an `index.ts` barrel file.
- **Component Location:**
  - Place shared components in `components/`.
  - Place route-specific components inside the relevant route folder.
- **Props:**
  - Use TypeScript interfaces for props.
  - Prefer explicit prop types and default values.
- **Testing:**
  - Co-locate tests with components (e.g., `UserCard.test.tsx`).

## 3. Naming Conventions (General)

- **Folders:** `kebab-case` (e.g., `user-profile/`)
- **Files:** `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for utilities/hooks, `kebab-case` for static assets
- **Variables/Functions:** `camelCase`
- **Types/Interfaces:** `PascalCase`
- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## 4. API Routes (Route Handlers)

- **Prefer API Routes over Edge Functions** unless you need ultra-low latency or geographic distribution.
- **Location:** Place API routes in `app/api/` (e.g., `app/api/users/route.ts`).
- **HTTP Methods:** Export async functions named after HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
- **Request/Response:** Use the Web `Request` and `Response` APIs. Use `NextRequest`/`NextResponse` for advanced features.
- **Dynamic Segments:** Use `[param]` for dynamic API routes (e.g., `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`).
- **Validation:** Always validate and sanitize input. Use libraries like `zod` or `yup`.
- **Error Handling:** Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- **Authentication:** Protect sensitive routes using middleware or server-side session checks.

### Route Handler usage note (performance)

- **Do not call your own Route Handlers from Server Components** (e.g., `fetch('/api/...')`) just to reuse logic. Prefer extracting shared logic into modules (e.g., `lib/`) and calling it directly to avoid extra server hops.

## 5. General Best Practices

- **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for all code. Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Enforce code style and linting. Use the official Next.js ESLint config. In Next.js 16, prefer running ESLint via the ESLint CLI (not `next lint`).
- **Environment Variables:** Store secrets in `.env.local`. Never commit secrets to version control.
  - In Next.js 16, `serverRuntimeConfig` / `publicRuntimeConfig` are removed. Use environment variables instead.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are **inlined at build time** (changing them after build won’t affect a deployed build).
  - If you truly need runtime evaluation of env in a dynamic context, follow Next.js guidance (e.g., call `connection()` before reading `process.env`).
- **Testing:** Use Jest, React Testing Library, or Playwright. Write tests for all critical logic and components.
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. Test with screen readers.
- **Performance:**
  - Use built-in Image and Font optimization.
  - Prefer **Cache Components** (`cacheComponents` + `use cache`) over legacy caching patterns.
  - Use Suspense and loading states for async data.
  - Avoid large client bundles; keep most logic in Server Components.
- **Security:**
  - Sanitize all user input.
  - Use HTTPS in production.
  - Set secure HTTP headers.
  - Prefer server-side authorization for Server Actions and Route Handlers; never trust client input.
- **Documentation:**
  - Write clear README and code comments.
  - Document public APIs and components.

## 6. Caching & Revalidation (Next.js 16 Cache Components)

- **Prefer Cache Components for memoization/caching** in the App Router.
  - Enable in `next.config.*` via `cacheComponents: true`.
  - Use the **`use cache` directive** to opt a component/function into caching.
- **Use cache tagging and lifetimes intentionally:**
  - Use `cacheTag(...)` to associate cached results with tags.
  - Use `cacheLife(...)` to control cache lifetime (presets or configured profiles).
- **Revalidation guidance:**
  - Prefer `revalidateTag(tag, 'max')` (stale-while-revalidate) for most cases.
  - The single-argument form `revalidateTag(tag)` is legacy/deprecated.
  - Use `updateTag(...)` inside **Server Actions** when you need “read-your-writes” / immediate consistency.
- **Avoid `unstable_cache`** for new code; treat it as legacy and migrate toward Cache Components.

## 7. Tooling updates (Next.js 16)

- **Turbopack is the default dev bundler.** Configure via the top-level `turbopack` field in `next.config.*` (do not use the removed `experimental.turbo`).
- **Typed routes are stable** via `typedRoutes` (TypeScript required).

# Avoid Unnecessary Example Files

Do not create example/demo files (like ModalExample.tsx) in the main codebase unless the user specifically requests a live example, Storybook story, or explicit documentation component. Keep the repository clean and production-focused by default.

# Always use the latest documentation and guides

- For every nextjs related request, begin by searching for the most current nextjs documentation, guides, and examples.
- Use the following tools to fetch and search documentation if they are available:
  - `resolve_library_id` to resolve the package/library name in the docs.
  - `get_library_docs` for up to date documentation.

# NestJS Development Best Practices

## Your Mission

As GitHub Copilot, you are an expert in NestJS development with deep knowledge of TypeScript, decorators, dependency injection, and modern Node.js patterns. Your goal is to guide developers in building scalable, maintainable, and well-architected server-side applications using NestJS framework principles and best practices.

## Core NestJS Principles

### **1. Dependency Injection (DI)**
- **Principle:** NestJS uses a powerful DI container that manages the instantiation and lifetime of providers.
- **Guidance for Copilot:**
  - Use `@Injectable()` decorator for services, repositories, and other providers
  - Inject dependencies through constructor parameters with proper typing
  - Prefer interface-based dependency injection for better testability
  - Use custom providers when you need specific instantiation logic

### **2. Modular Architecture**
- **Principle:** Organize code into feature modules that encapsulate related functionality.
- **Guidance for Copilot:**
  - Create feature modules with `@Module()` decorator
  - Import only necessary modules and avoid circular dependencies
  - Use `forRoot()` and `forFeature()` patterns for configurable modules
  - Implement shared modules for common functionality

### **3. Decorators and Metadata**
- **Principle:** Leverage decorators to define routes, middleware, guards, and other framework features.
- **Guidance for Copilot:**
  - Use appropriate decorators: `@Controller()`, `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Injectable()`
  - Apply validation decorators from `class-validator` library
  - Use custom decorators for cross-cutting concerns
  - Implement metadata reflection for advanced scenarios

## Project Structure Best Practices

### **Recommended Directory Structure**
```
src/
├── app.module.ts
├── main.ts
├── common/
│   ├── decorators/
│   ├── filters/
│   ├── guards/
│   ├── interceptors/
│   ├── pipes/
│   └── interfaces/
├── config/
├── modules/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── users/
│   └── products/
└── shared/
    ├── services/
    └── constants/
```

### **File Naming Conventions**
- **Controllers:** `*.controller.ts` (e.g., `users.controller.ts`)
- **Services:** `*.service.ts` (e.g., `users.service.ts`)
- **Modules:** `*.module.ts` (e.g., `users.module.ts`)
- **DTOs:** `*.dto.ts` (e.g., `create-user.dto.ts`)
- **Entities:** `*.entity.ts` (e.g., `user.entity.ts`)
- **Guards:** `*.guard.ts` (e.g., `auth.guard.ts`)
- **Interceptors:** `*.interceptor.ts` (e.g., `logging.interceptor.ts`)
- **Pipes:** `*.pipe.ts` (e.g., `validation.pipe.ts`)
- **Filters:** `*.filter.ts` (e.g., `http-exception.filter.ts`)

## API Development Patterns

### **1. Controllers**
- Keep controllers thin - delegate business logic to services
- Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Implement comprehensive input validation with DTOs
- Apply guards and interceptors at the appropriate level

```typescript
@Controller('users')
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
export class UsersController {
  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Get()
  @UseInterceptors(TransformInterceptor)
  async findAll(@Query() query: GetUsersDto): Promise<User[]> {
    return this.usersService.findAll(query);
  }

  @Post()
  @UsePipes(ValidationPipe)
  async create(@Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDto): Promise<User> {
    return this.usersService.create(createUserDto);
  }
}
```

### **2. Services**
- Implement business logic in services, not controllers
- Use constructor-based dependency injection
- Create focused, single-responsibility services
- Handle errors appropriately and let filters catch them

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private readonly userRepository: Repository<User>,
    private readonly emailService: EmailService,
  ) {}

  async create(createUserDto: CreateUserDto): Promise<User> {
    const user = this.userRepository.create(createUserDto);
    const savedUser = await this.userRepository.save(user);
    await this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(savedUser.email);
    return savedUser;
  }
}
```

### **3. DTOs and Validation**
- Use class-validator decorators for input validation
- Create separate DTOs for different operations (create, update, query)
- Implement proper transformation with class-transformer

```typescript
export class CreateUserDto {
  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  @Length(2, 50)
  name: string;

  @IsEmail()
  email: string;

  @IsString()
  @MinLength(8)
  @Matches(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/, {
    message: 'Password must contain uppercase, lowercase and number',
  })
  password: string;
}
```

## Database Integration

### **TypeORM Integration**
- Use TypeORM as the primary ORM for database operations
- Define entities with proper decorators and relationships
- Implement repository pattern for data access
- Use migrations for database schema changes

```typescript
@Entity('users')
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
  id: string;

  @Column({ unique: true })
  email: string;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column({ select: false })
  password: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Post, post => post.author)
  posts: Post[];

  @CreateDateColumn()
  createdAt: Date;

  @UpdateDateColumn()
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### **Custom Repositories**
- Extend base repository functionality when needed
- Implement complex queries in repository methods
- Use query builders for dynamic queries

## Authentication and Authorization

### **JWT Authentication**
- Implement JWT-based authentication with Passport
- Use guards to protect routes
- Create custom decorators for user context

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> {
    return super.canActivate(context);
  }

  handleRequest(err: any, user: any, info: any) {
    if (err || !user) {
      throw err || new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return user;
  }
}
```

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- Implement RBAC using custom guards and decorators
- Use metadata to define required roles
- Create flexible permission systems

```typescript
@SetMetadata('roles', ['admin'])
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Delete(':id')
async remove(@Param('id') id: string): Promise<void> {
  return this.usersService.remove(id);
}
```

## Error Handling and Logging

### **Exception Filters**
- Create global exception filters for consistent error responses
- Handle different types of exceptions appropriately
- Log errors with proper context

```typescript
@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(AllExceptionsFilter.name);

  catch(exception: unknown, host: ArgumentsHost): void {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse<Response>();
    const request = ctx.getRequest<Request>();

    const status = exception instanceof HttpException 
      ? exception.getStatus() 
      : HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR;

    this.logger.error(`${request.method} ${request.url}`, exception);

    response.status(status).json({
      statusCode: status,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      path: request.url,
      message: exception instanceof HttpException 
        ? exception.message 
        : 'Internal server error',
    });
  }
}
```

### **Logging**
- Use built-in Logger class for consistent logging
- Implement proper log levels (error, warn, log, debug, verbose)
- Add contextual information to logs

## Testing Strategies

### **Unit Testing**
- Test services independently using mocks
- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Create comprehensive test suites for business logic

```typescript
describe('UsersService', () => {
  let service: UsersService;
  let repository: Repository<User>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
      providers: [
        UsersService,
        {
          provide: getRepositoryToken(User),
          useValue: {
            create: jest.fn(),
            save: jest.fn(),
            find: jest.fn(),
          },
        },
      ],
    }).compile();

    service = module.get<UsersService>(UsersService);
    repository = module.get<Repository<User>>(getRepositoryToken(User));
  });

  it('should create a user', async () => {
    const createUserDto = { name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' };
    const user = { id: '1', ...createUserDto };

    jest.spyOn(repository, 'create').mockReturnValue(user as User);
    jest.spyOn(repository, 'save').mockResolvedValue(user as User);

    expect(await service.create(createUserDto)).toEqual(user);
  });
});
```

### **Integration Testing**
- Use TestingModule for integration tests
- Test complete request/response cycles
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### **E2E Testing**
- Test complete application flows
- Use supertest for HTTP testing
- Test authentication and authorization flows

## Performance and Security

### **Performance Optimization**
- Implement caching strategies with Redis
- Use interceptors for response transformation
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### **Security Best Practices**
- Validate all inputs using class-validator
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use CORS appropriately for cross-origin requests
- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

```typescript
// Rate limiting example
@Controller('auth')
@UseGuards(ThrottlerGuard)
export class AuthController {
  @Post('login')
  @Throttle(5, 60) // 5 requests per minute
  async login(@Body() loginDto: LoginDto) {
    return this.authService.login(loginDto);
  }
}
```

## Configuration Management

### **Environment Configuration**
- Use @nestjs/config for configuration management
- Validate configuration at startup
- Use different configs for different environments

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ConfigService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(CONFIGURATION_TOKEN)
    private readonly config: Configuration,
  ) {}

  get databaseUrl(): string {
    return this.config.database.url;
  }

  get jwtSecret(): string {
    return this.config.jwt.secret;
  }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Circular Dependencies:** Avoid importing modules that create circular references
- **Heavy Controllers:** Don't put business logic in controllers
- **Missing Error Handling:** Always handle errors appropriately
- **Improper DI Usage:** Don't create instances manually when DI can handle it
- **Missing Validation:** Always validate input data
- **Synchronous Operations:** Use async/await for database and external API calls
- **Memory Leaks:** Properly dispose of subscriptions and event listeners

## Development Workflow

### **Development Setup**
1. Use NestJS CLI for scaffolding: `nest generate module users`
2. Follow consistent file organization
3. Use TypeScript strict mode
4. Implement comprehensive linting with ESLint
5. Use Prettier for code formatting

### **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] Proper use of decorators and dependency injection
- [ ] Input validation with DTOs and class-validator
- [ ] Appropriate error handling and exception filters
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Proper module organization and imports
- [ ] Security considerations (authentication, authorization, input sanitization)
- [ ] Performance considerations (caching, database optimization)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing coverage

## Conclusion

NestJS provides a powerful, opinionated framework for building scalable Node.js applications. By following these best practices, you can create maintainable, testable, and efficient server-side applications that leverage the full power of TypeScript and modern development patterns.
